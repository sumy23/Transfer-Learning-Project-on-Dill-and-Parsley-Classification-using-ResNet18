# Transfer-Learning-Project-on-Dill-and-Parsley-Classification-using-ResNet18
In this project, a pre-trained ResNet18 model was fine-tuned using transfer learning to classify images of dill and parsley. The model was trained on a small dataset and achieved high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning even with limited data.
